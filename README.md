Welcome to the CrunchyCrawler.
Please use it as you like, but don't market it as your product. Suggestions for improvement are welcome.


## Run Locally

Download the release version and execute the following command.

  java -jar CrunchyCrawler.jar
```

Please note that you need Java 21 and Google Chrome!
Close your browser before starting.



## Usage/Examples

When you start the programme, it asks for your "user-data-dir" folder. This is required to bypass the CloudFlare protection. 
Then simply follow the further steps in the console.

After running Chrunchyroll, the browser will close and you will be asked for a folder to save the two files. There is an XML file which you can use as an import for Anilist. The other file generally saves all results in a .txt file. In this file you will also find the anime that could not be assigned.

It may happen that you cannot import the XML file into Anilist. This is because some MAL (myanimelist) IDs are not registered with Anilist. Then you have to delete the entries manually in the XML file or use the .txt file to search for your anime in Anilist
